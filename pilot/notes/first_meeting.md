# First meeting

Jan 23rd, 2019
Ben, Courtney, Mel, and Jared

## Project Goal
Produce a "quick and dirty" global map of wastewater impact on coast oceans. 
The necessary deliverable is a global map and, presumably,
a methods document.
A secondary (but not required) goal is to streamline the analysis and 
move it, as much as possible, into R.

## Next Steps
1. Identify and examine [input data sets](https://github.com/jkibele/wastewater/issues/1)
2. [Model watershed level distribution of national statistics](https://github.com/jkibele/wastewater/issues/2)
3. Model dispersment of plumes (use existing code for this - only recode if there's plenty of time. Really Jared, don't start with this.)

## Further meetings:
We'll establish weekly meetings after official project start (Feb 1st).
